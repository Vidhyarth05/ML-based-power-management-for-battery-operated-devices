# üîã Smart Power Management for Battery-Operated Devices using K-Means Clustering

This project optimizes power usage in battery-operated devices by analyzing device behavior using **unsupervised learning**. With the help of **K-Means Clustering**, the system dynamically assigns one of two power modes ‚Äî **Normal Mode** and **Power-Saving Mode** ‚Äî based on real usage patterns extracted from smartphone activity data.

## Overview

Modern battery-powered devices need intelligent power control systems to extend battery life without affecting performance. This project proposes a **machine learning-based solution** that classifies power consumption behavior without needing labeled data, using clustering algorithms.

### Project Highlights

-  K-Means Clustering applied to power usage patterns
-  Classifies device behavior into two modes:
  - **Cluster 0** ‚Üí Normal Mode
  - **Cluster 1** ‚Üí Power-Saving Mode *(or vice versa depending on cluster center values)*
-  Visual analysis through multiple plots
-  Preprocessing and dimensionality reduction using PCA
-  Multiple datasets used: original and cleaned versions

##  Visualizations Included

-  **Feature Distribution Histogram**
-  **Correlation Heatmap**
-  **Top 10 Principal Features (PCA)**
-  **Elbow Method Plot** ‚Äì for optimal k
-  **Scree Plot** ‚Äì variance explained by components
-  **2D Cluster Visualization** using PCA-transformed features

##  How it Works

1. **Load and Clean Data**
   - Remove irrelevant features
   - Handle missing values
   - Normalize and scale features

2. **Apply PCA**
   - Reduce dimensions while preserving variance
   - Select top 10 contributing features

3. **Clustering with K-Means**
   - Set `k=2` for binary mode classification
   - Assign clusters to represent power modes

4. **Visualization**
   - Graphical representation of clusters, distributions, and feature importance
